## Who Made This?
This Amazing project was made by The Great Alex Garcia.

## What Was Used?
For this project I used HTML and CSS of course to mark up and style my game page. I also used JavaScript 
for user interaction with the game. I used mostly functions, eventListeners, DOM manupilation to change events when operated by the user such as clicking on a color and buttons and empty arrays to both store random number order for computer to play and player input and computer input orders.

## Why Was it Made?
This Project was made, not because I was forced too, but for a class unit project and becuase it was challenging enough that it overloading the few brain cells I have left. So yeah, Thanks Hammad and Roger.

## When Was it Made?
This project was made in 4 days, yes it took that long to make. It was made in the 4th week of GA course during the first week of December 2019, from the 2nd to the 6th.

## Where Was it Made?
This project was mostly made on GA campus in DC and some at home with lots of alcohol and little to nothing sleep. Not a bad week, right?

## Instructions
The instructions to this game are pretty simple and if you're old enough to have enjoyed a childhood then you would have played the original game. But if not, them here it is.
Step 1. Clear your head and relax.
Step 2. Click on the 'Start' button to start the game.
Step 3. Allow the computer to display the order of lights it plays.
Step 4. Click on the colors displayed by the computer in the correct order.
Step 5. If you click the right order then it will move you up in level. If not then you lose and the game will start from level 1. There are 20 levels in total for now.
Step 6. Enjoy yourself.
